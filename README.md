What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?

1.	In this dataset, Theater is the dominant category by sheer numbers, with the largest success and failures.The second largest category is music, with Indie Rock and Rock getting the most successful campaigns
2.	In this data, food and publishing seem to be the toughest categories to get funded, with high failure rates in each category.
3.	May seems to be the month with the highest successful ventures.

What are some of the limitations of this dataset?
We cannot necessarily determine what causes each campaign to be successful or not successful, just based on the data.  We can try and correlate goals to success rates, but in this data the success or failure rate is only considerably higher or lower for the extreme ends of the funding goals ranges.  The lowest goals got funded quite a bit more (<$1000) and the highest goals had the lowest success rates, but there was a lot of categories in the middle that had similar success rates - whether they were moderately low or moderately high.  There did seem to be a “sweet spot” with a goal between $25K and $30K where the success rate was higher.

We could look at the success rate by Staff Pick, but maybe the campaigns that failed were just bad ideas.  This cannot be necessarily gleaned from the data at hand.

What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?
We can look at the success rate by Country and combine with the other variables, such as category or staff pick.  Maybe the staff picks better in certain countries or maybe some countries support their documentaries better.

We could try and make some conclusions based on donation size in relation to goal.  Are small goal campaigns more likely to get small donations?  Do successful campaigns need large donations?
